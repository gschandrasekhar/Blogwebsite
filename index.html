        <h1> How video games are made: the game development process</h1>
      </b>
    </div>
    
    <b>
      Want to know how video games are made? This article walks through the
      video game development process, and in particular, the 'pipeline' – an
      industry term that refers to the process of making a video game from
      scratch</b>
      <br>
      
      <img src="/cse1002.jpg " alt="car Image" class="center">
      <hr>
    
    <h2>what is the game development pipeline?</h2>
    <p>
      The game development pipeline is the process of building a video game from
      concept to completion
    </p>
    <h3>
      Much like a production line, the game development pipeline helps organize
      the flow of work so that everyone knows what they need to deliver and when
    </h3>
    <p>
      The pipeline also helps manage the game development timeline and budget,
      reducing inefficiencies and bottlenecks.
    </p>
     
    <p>
      While pipelines vary between projects and studios, the process is fairly
      similar whether you’re working on a AAA, indie or mobile game.
    </p>
    <p>
      A game is continuously evolving, and things which sounded great in theory
      may not work so well in reality. Therefore, the pipeline is not
      necessarily a linear process. Work must be sent for creative approvals and
      can often be sent back for revisions. Pipelines must be flexible enough to
      factor in revisions and course changes.
    </p>
  
    <h1>The 3 stages of game development</h1>
    <p>
      Video game development is typically divided into 3 stages:<b>
        pre-production, production, and post-production</b
      >
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h2>pre production</h2>
      </li>
      <p>
        This is where every project begins. Essentially, pre-production defines
        what the game is about, why it should be made, and what it’s going to
        take to make it.
      </p>
      <b3>
      <p>
        You might have a great idea for a type of game, a story you want to
        bring to life, or you may want to build one that leverages a certain
        type of technology (e.g. VR, a new controller, or console).
      </p>
      <b> In pre-production, you’ll find answers to questions like:</b>
      <br>
<div class="box1">
      <ul>
        <li>What is the game about?</li>
        <li>Who is the audience?</li>
        <li>Is there a market for it? What’s the competition like?</li>
        <li>Which platform will it be published on?</li>
        <li>
          How will it be monetized? Will it be sold on a platform, or free to
          play with in-game purchases?
        </li>
        <li>How long will it take to develop?</li>
        <li>What staff and resources will it require?</li>
        <li>What is the estimated budget?</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <br>
      <img src="/cse1013.jpg" alt="image in a game" class="center">
      <p>
        This stage can last anywhere between a week to a year, depending on the
        project type, resources, and finances available, and typically takes up
        to 20% of the total production time.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, the team is quite small. There may be a producer,
        programmer/s, a concept artist (or if you’re a one-person operation,
        you’ll be doing most of it!).
      </p>
      <p>
        A video game producer handles the business aspect of the project,
        particularly the financials. They manage the budget and develop
        marketing strategies to sell the product.
      </p>
      <p>
        A concept artist sets the tone for the project early on by developing
        artwork and sketches. These early visuals help form the language of the
        game, giving everyone working on the project a visual guide to the
        overall look and feel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The information gathered during this stage of pre-production forms the
        basis of the Game Design Document.
      </p>
      <h3>The Game Design Document (GDD)</h3>
      <p>
        A Game Design Document (GDD) is essentially the game's north star. It’s
        a living document which helps everyone understand and get on board with
        the greater vision of the project.
      </p>
      <b>The GDD includes things like:</b>
      <div class="box1">
      <ul>
        <li>The idea or concept</li>
        <li>Genre</li>
        <li>Story and characters</li>
        <li>Core game mechanics</li>
        <li>Gameplay</li>
        <li>Level and world design</li>
        <li>rt and/or sketches</li>
        <li>Monetization strategy</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <p>
        As a living document, the GDD is continuously updated and refined
        throughout production. This could be due to technical or financial
        restraints, or simply realizing that things just don’t look, play or
        work as well as you had initially hoped.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people, especially smaller developers, like to use more agile
        development techniques which are less about process and documentation
        and more about just building things. However, larger studios prefer a
        different approach.
      </p>
      <h3>
        EA, Microsoft, Sony, Ubisoft and other large game companies are highly
        process-driven and require heavy documentation. It's a big part of how
        they have achieved success over and over again.
      </h3>
      <p>
        A GDD keeps you organized, helps identify potential risks, and lets you
        see ahead of time who you may need to hire/outsource to in order to
        bring your project to life. Your game idea may seem fairly
        straightforward, but once you lay it out in a GDD, you might soon
        realize just how big and resource-heavy your project is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Projects without a plan are much more likely to run over time and
        budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another reason to have a GDD is to help pitch and finance your game.
        Potential investors will want to see a solid plan before investing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the GDD will help you market your product once it’s ready to be
        released.
      </p>
      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
      <p>
        A video game prototype is a raw test that checks functionality, user
        experience, gameplay, mechanics, and art direction.
      </p>
      <br>
      <img src="/cse1006.jpg" alt="game seigning"  class="center">
      <p>
        Prototyping happens in pre-production to test whether or not the game
        idea will work, and if it is worthwhile to pursue. Many ideas do not
        make it past this stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team will often start with paper designs to test theories and work
        out many of the nuances of a game or a series of systems quickly, easily
        and cost effectively.
      </p>
      <h3>
        While ideas, psychology, theories and other deep thinking metaphors are
        important, you can only design so far in your head or on paper. Most
        game ideas need to be touched, felt, played and tested sooner rather
        than later.
      </h3>
      <br>
      <img src="/cse1005.jpg" alt="image from a game "  class="center">
      <p>
        The aim is to get a prototype up and running ASAP to test if your ideas
        actually work and if the game is as fun as you had hoped. Prototyping
        can also reveal unexpected challenges, which could potentially change
        the entire course of your project. It’s important to have others test
        your prototype too, because things that are obvious to you, may not be
        to others.
      </p>
      <br>
      <img src="/cse1007.jpg" alt="game development "  class="center">
      <br>
        Placeholder assets are used to save time and money. These low-quality
        assets stand in for things like weapons and props during the early
        testing phase, and if approved, they’re replaced with final,
        high-quality versions later on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Placeholder assets can be purchased or found for free online within game
        development software. They're generally pretty basic shapes, but can
        also be a little more advanced, for example, this Soul: Cave asset pack
        by Epic Games for Unreal Engine 4:
      </p>
      <li>
        <h2>production</h2>
      </li>
      <p>
        Production is the longest stage of the pipeline, and it’s all hands on
        deck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ranging anywhere from 1 to 4 years, production is where the game really
        starts to take shape. The story is refined, assets (characters,
        creatures, props and environments) are created, the rules of play are
        set, levels and worlds are built, code is written, and so much more!
      </p>
      <h3>
        Almost everything in a video game is a conscious decision. This includes
        every character, environment, object, as well as the look, colors,
        sounds, level of difficulty, rules and point-scoring system.
      </h3>
      <p>
        However initial ideas don’t always translate so well in reality, so as
        the work is being done, the game is being continuously tested and
        refined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s take a look at the major game production milestones, and some of
        the key video game development jobs, keeping in mind that smaller teams
        will be required to undertake multiple roles, whereas a larger studio
        will have more staff, many of whom specialize in a particular aspect of
        production.
      </p>
      <br>

      <h3>Production milestones</h3>
      <p>
        There are a number of milestones to hit throughout the game development
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Prototype: </b>
        This is the initial test of the game (which happens in pre-production
        and is described in detail above). Some games may never make it past
        this stage
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>First playable:</b> The first playable gives a much better idea of
        the look and gameplay. While it is still far from final, placeholders
        are replaced with higher quality assets, and artwork is added.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Vertical slice: </b>
        A vertical slice is a fully playable sample that can be used to pitch
        your game to studios or investors. Ranging from just a few minutes up to
        half an hour, a vertical slice provides a first-hand experience of your
        game.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Pre-alpha: </b>
        The majority of the content is developed in the pre-alpha stage. At this
        point in game development, some big decisions will need to be made.
        Content may get cut, or new elements will need to be added to improve
        gameplay
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Alpha: </b>
        The game is “feature complete” meaning the main features have all been
        added and the game is fully playable from start to finish. Some
        elements, such as art assets may still need to be added, but controls
        and functionality should be working properly. The QA testers will be
        making sure everything is running seamlessly and reporting errors back
        to the team.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Beta: </b>
        At this point, all the content and assets are integrated, and the team
        should be focused on optimization rather than adding new functions or
        features.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b> Gold master: </b>
        The game is final and ready to be sent to the publishing outlet and
        released to the public.
      </p>
      <h3>Key game development roles</h3>
      <br>
      <img src="/cse1001.jpg" alt="image from minecraft "  class="center">
      <p>
        Game dev roles will vary depending on the size and type of studio. These
        are some of the common positions you'll find.
      </p>
      <h3>Project manager</h3>

      <p>
        The project manager makes sure the game development process runs
        smoothly, milestones are met, risks are anticipated/mitigated, and team
        members are doing what they’re supposed to. They are often the centre of
        communication between the dev and design teams and executives. Project
        managers are exceptionally organized and must have excellent
        communication and people skills.
      </p>
      <h3>Game developers / programmers</h3>
      <p>
        Game programmers help develop games by turning design concepts into code
        to create fully playable games
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmers are often software engineers or computer scientists with a
        strong programming background, plus a combination of creativity, math
        skills and patience to successfully code ideas into interactive visuals
        and sounds. They ensure the game runs smoothly.
      </p>
      <b>There are many different aspects of programming, including:</b>
      <div class="box1">
      <ul>
        <li>Building a customized base engine for the game</li>
        <li>Scripting functions, events, interactions</li>
        <li>
          Creating physics (e.g. gravity differences in a game set in space)
        </li>
        <li>Developing and modifying 3D graphic renders</li>
        <li>Simulating artificial intelligence in opponents</li>
        <li>Adding sound effects, music, and voice-overs</li>
        <li>Implementing game logic and mechanic</li>
        <li>Creating the user interface</li>
        <li>Writing code specific to keyboard, mice, or joysticks</li>
        <li>
          Making it possible for players to compete or cooperate via LAN or the
          internet
        </li>
        <li>Developing custom tools</li>
        <li>Porting code between platforms</li>
        <li>
          Implementing algorithms, addressing memory requirements and caching
          issues
        </li>
        <li>Identifying and fixing bugs</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <p>Identifying and fixing bugs</p>
      <p>
        The average programmer makes USD $59,010 per year, however, a senior or
        lead programmer can earn in excess of USD $100,000 per year. A game
        programming course can equip you with the skills to get your first game
        programming job in the industry.
      </p>
      <h3>Game designers</h3>
      <p>
        A game designer is the creative driver of the game, and generally a
        cross between a writer and an artist, with some knowledge of
        programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game design production pipeline section involves creating compelling
        stories, characters, goals, rules, and challenges that drive
        interactions with other characters, users, or objects.
      </p>
      <b>Designers may be responsible for:</b>
      <div class="box1">
      <ul>
        <li>Developing the storyline, character back-stories, and dialogue</li>
        <li>Developing gameplay, rules, and the scoring system</li>
        <li>Determining the level of difficulty</li>
        <li>Building environments, ledges, obstacles, and objects</li>
        <li>Level and world design</li>
        <li>Programming/scripting</li>
        <li>Digital editing</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <p>
        If working for a larger company, these tasks could resemble individual
        roles, which we’ll cover next.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Payscale, the average game designer salary is USD $63,838,
        while a lead can make in excess of USD $93,926 (depending on experience,
        location, size of studio, and industry). Senior and technical designers
        may exceed this range. Check out the Game Design Course to get an idea
        of the skills needed for a job in game design
      </p>
      <h3>Level designers</h3>
      <p>
        A video game level designer is responsible for creating interesting and
        fun levels. Their job is to keep the player focused on moving through
        the game and achieving their goal or mission while reducing the
        potential of confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because games are far more complex than they used to be, it’s common at
        larger studios to find game designers dedicated just to level design.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Level designers take inspiration from the concept art, photo reference,
        and GDD to sketch believable maps and create physical models of levels.
      </h2>
      <p>
        Depending on the type of game and whether it is based on actual events
        (such as a WW2 battle), they may need to learn all about a particular
        period of history and research actual locations to ensure the level is
        realistic and believable. If the game is adapted from a book or movie,
        they’ll need to read/watch the original and look for clues. If the world
        is entirely fictional, they’ll need to use their creativity and draw
        inspiration from the concept art provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then using a level editor (software used to design levels and maps),
        they build the levels, stages or missions. Their job can also include
        things like planning start and exit locations, determining where tunnels
        and hidden passageways will be, places where interactions or dialogue
        will take place, monster spawn points, trigger points where certain
        actions will take place, and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Level designers are responsible for identifying and fixing bugs, such as
        players falling out of bounds or getting stuck and not being able to get
        out. The challenge with video games is that once the game is released,
        it is out of the designer’s hands. The player can interact with the
        worlds in unexpected ways, bringing to light bugs which had gone
        unnoticed during development.
      </p>
      <p>The level will likely see several versions before becoming final.</p>
      <p>
        A level designer can earn on average USD $56,884 depending on studio and
        location. Senior or more experienced designers can demand a much higher
        salary.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re interested in becoming a level designer, the Game Design
        Course teaches the process of turning concepts into prototypes, how to
        make a level fun, ensure your level is visually interesting, incorporate
        storytelling, and build and script your level in a game engine.
      </p>
      <h3>Game artists</h3>
      <p>
        Game artists can include concept artists, animators, 3D modelers and FX
        artists.
      </p>
      <p>
        This group is responsible for bringing color, movement, and life to the
        game.

      <p>
        While a concept artist is mostly active during pre-production when
        they’re designing the initial look (typically in 2D), they may be
        brought in again later in the game development process if new elements
        are added or the game changes course.
      </p>
      <p>
        A 3D concept artist (which could be the same artist) uses digital
        sculpting software like ZBrush, Maya and Photoshop to create 3D props,
        assets and environments. They’ll also add textures and details.

      <h3>3D modelers</h3>
      <p>
        3D modelers create models of people, objects, props, weapons, and
        environments which can then be textured and animated as needed. Modelers
        need to know how to gather and use high-quality reference materials,
        especially if they’re replicating real objects (e.g. an AK-47, Buzzard
        Attack Chopper, the Eiffel Tower, etc).
      </p>
      <p>
        Modelers may use photos of the objects they’re creating, or drones if
        the object is much larger and they need an aerial view. If the game is
        all fantasy, they’ll need to reference the concept art and use their
        imagination to come up with something new and unique.

      <h3>Game animators</h3>
      <p>
        Game animators add depth and realism by adding believable movement to
        characters, objects, and environments. They’ll create storyboards and
        map out key animation scenes that align with the game’s storyline.
      </p>
      <p>
        Animators often need to conduct lots of research (e.g. observing how
        animals behave and interact with others if working on an animal-based
        game). Motion capture data can also be used to help create more lifelike
        animations.
      </p>
      <h3>FX artists</h3>
      <p>
        FX artists give players a more immersive and entertaining experience by
        adding stunning effects such as explosions, smoke, fire and liquid
        simulations, and weather events such as rain, lightning, blizzards, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Game FX artists tend to use software such as Houdini FX or Maya, but
        should also have experience game engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine
        4.
      </p>
      <h3>Audio engineers / sounddesigners / composers</h3>
      <p>
        The sound experts develop realistic sound effects, record
        voice-overs/dialogue between characters, and create soundtracks that set
        the mood for players, adding suspense or audio cues (e.g. opening music,
        menu pause music, marking a victory, etc).
      </p>
      <h3>QA (quality assurance) / video game testers</h3>
      <p>
        Video game testers are essential in the game development process! These
        people test games, look for bugs and ensure the game runs smoothly and
        instructions are clear for players. They report errors to the dev team
        in what's sometimes known as a bug sheet.
      </p>
      <h3>Additional roles</h3>
      <p>
        Besides the game development roles mentioned above, larger studios may
        have the capacity to bring on a number of additional specialists, such
        as:
      </p>
      <div class="box1">
      <ul>
        <li>Quest designers</li>
        <li>Combat designers</li>
        <li>Writers</li>
        <li>Interpreters and translators</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
      <p>
        Later in the game development process, the product team plays more of a
        role, helping to handle the marketing and distribution of the game
      </p>

      <h2>Post-production</h2>
      <p>
Once production is complete and the game has shipped, the game development
 process continues with some team members being relegated to maintenance 
 (fixing bugs, creating patches) or creating bonus or downloadable content
  (DLC). Others may move onto the sequel or the next project.

        A post-mortem or debrief may be held to discuss what worked/didn’t
         work and determine what could be done better next time. All the design
          documents, assets and code are finalized, gathered and stored, in
           case they are needed in the future.</p>
